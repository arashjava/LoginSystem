# LoginSystem
A Login system using PHP, JavaScript, MySQL 
In this system a signup/login is developed and just for the sake of showing demo there is also a "user list" to 
let the signed user see the list of registered users. You can consider this system as a login tool for your project.
You need to:
1- Create a user table; user "sql" file for this purpose.
2- set the MySQL password in "mysql.php" file.
Good to go!
